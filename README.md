Based on Kaggle's [competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/digit-recognizer) based on the famous MNIST data.

The file [image-classification.ipynb](image-classification.ipynb) is the main file for running the recognition.

So far, we have used Naive Bayes, which has performed pretty terribly (~.83). A few things that I would like to try:
 
 - Simple SVM: https://www.kaggle.com/archaeocharlie/digit-recognizer/a-beginner-s-approach-to-classification
 - Deep Neural Network (using Keros): https://www.kaggle.com/poonaml/deep-neural-network-keras-way
 - Multi Layer Perceptron: https://www.kaggle.com/fchollet/simple-deep-mlp-with-keras/code/output
 - Dimensionality Reduction (together used with SVM maybe) https://www.kaggle.com/arthurtok/interactive-intro-to-dimensionality-reduction
 - Tensorflow: https://www.tensorflow.org/get_started/mnist/beginners
